# ANOVA_Test_in_R
This statistical method is used to analyze differences among group means in a sample. It's particularly useful in experimental design to assess whether any of several group means are different from each other significantly.

Conclusions from the ANOVA analysis:
The P-values for both 'bloco' and 'linhas' are significantly higher than the typical alpha level of 0.05. This indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in 'zinco' levels across different 'bloco' and 'linhas' categories.
The F-statistics for both factors are relatively low, reinforcing the conclusion that these factors do not significantly influence the variability of 'zinco'.
The high P-values lead us to fail to reject the null hypothesis for both 'bloco' and 'linhas', suggesting that these factors do not have a significant impact on 'zinco' levels based on this dataset.

This analysis suggests that neither 'bloco' nor 'linhas' are significant predictors of the variable 'zinco' in the provided dataset.
